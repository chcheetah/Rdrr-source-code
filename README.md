# Rdrr source code
 This repo is the source code for Rdrr, a twitter thread reading app published on the Google Play under Harsh the Developer. 
 
 Some salient features of the app as published on the play store:

 - Dark Mode: For those who don't like using the app in light mode
 - Infinite Scrolling page: Loads the parent tweet & all replies to it in an infinite scrolling page, so that you do not have to go over it again
 - Custom Font size: Lets you choose the size of the font.
