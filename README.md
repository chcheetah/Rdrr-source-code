<h2>Some Salient Features</h2>

**Dark Mode Delight:**
Rdrr's Dark Mode feature is designed with your comfort in mind. Whether you're browsing Twitter threads late at night or simply prefer a darker interface, Dark Mode provides an eye-friendly experience. Say goodbye to the harsh glare of bright screens and immerse yourself in the thread's content without straining your eyes.

**Infinite Scroll Magic:**
Gone are the days of repeatedly clicking or tapping to load new tweets in a thread. Rdrr's Infinite Scroll takes the hassle out of navigating lengthy threads. With a flick of your finger or a scroll of your mouse wheel, you can seamlessly explore parent tweets and all the intricate replies associated with them. This continuous scrolling means you won't miss any part of the conversation, and you'll find yourself effortlessly engaged with the content.

**Fontsize Freedom:**
Reading should be an enjoyable experience, and that's why Rdrr offers Fontsize Freedom. Customize the font size to suit your preferences. Whether you're a fan of larger text for easy reading or prefer a more compact layout to fit more on the screen, you're in control. With the ability to adjust the font size, your reading experience becomes tailored to your individual comfort and style, ensuring you can focus on the content without any hindrance.
